            <p>
              Dynasty Rankings are sourced from Keep Trade Cut, Fantasy Pros, Fantasy Calc and
              Dynasty Process. These rankings are the best way to determine the power of your team
              from a dynasty league perspective. They combine player values from those sites with
              your fantasy football league. The teams are then ranked based on thier total aggregate
              values. The heatmap table shown has rankings for each of the aggregate position groups
              QB, RB, WR, and TE as well as aggregates for your starters, bench, and draft picks.
              You can hover over the table to see the actual values.

          <a-collapse-panel key="6" header="How does the trade calculator work?">
            <p>
              The SuperFlex Trade Value Calculator utilizes a sophisticated algorithm designed to
              assess player values in the complex ecosystem of fantasy football. It's built on the
              foundation of understanding that not all players are created equal. Our model goes
              beyond simple metrics, taking into account the inherent scarcity of top-tier talent
              and the real-world constraints of roster spots. It dynamically adjusts player values,
              ensuring that the rare gems are valued according to their true scarcity and impact,
              while also considering the diminishing returns of stacking multiple lower-tier players
              against elite options. This approach allows for more nuanced and strategic
              decision-making to give you an edge in your fantasy football league.
